biotoolsXSD is a formalised XML schema (XSD) which defines a resource description model for bioinformatics.  It can be used to describe software including databases, tools, services and so on, available under a variety of interfaces.  biotoolsXSD defines 55 important scientific, technical and administrative attributes.  It concentrates upon the salient common features, with a minimal core of 10 attributes, mandating the necessary and sufficient information to support resource search and discovery.  It is used by the Tools & Data Services Registry (https://bio.tools/).
